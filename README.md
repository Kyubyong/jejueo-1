This is the official repo for [Jejueo Datasets for Machine Translation and Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12071).

## Abstract
Jejueo was classified as critically endangered by UNESCO in 2010. Although diverse efforts to revitalize it have been made, there have
been few computational approaches. Motivated by this, we construct two new Jejueo datasets: Jejueo Interview Transcripts (JIT) and
Jejueo Single Speaker Speech (JSS). The JIT dataset is a parallel corpus containing 170k+ Jejueo-Korean sentences, and the JSS dataset
consists of 10k high-quality audio files recorded by a native Jejueo speaker and a transcript file. Subsequently, we build neural systems
of machine translation and speech synthesis using them. All resources are publicly available via our GitHub repository. We hope that
these datasets will attract interest of both language and machine learning communities.
